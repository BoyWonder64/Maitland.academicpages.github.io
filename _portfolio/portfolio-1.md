### Source Code in under: /src/CodeProjects/Hangman
[Link to Repo: Banking Repository](https://github.com/BoyWonder64/GroupProject3750-Hangman)
- Written using the MERN Stack
- Set Up a basic server using Express to handle API requests.
- My contributions
    - I set up the CSV library
    - The guessing logic /guess and /hangman routes
    - The setup for sessions that helps select a word from the list
- Established a basic frontend and backend that communicated to each other.
- Create a database that contains various references to Marvel, Star Wars, and DBZ
- The largest challenge I faced was learning how to properly format the frontend page.
- Most of what was completed was done in react.
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would probably incorporate tailwinds and use more animations.
    - I have been meaning to get into animating on my pages to improve the user experience. 
    - Finally, I would add a fun twist to the game.
