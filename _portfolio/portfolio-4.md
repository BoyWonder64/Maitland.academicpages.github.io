### Source Code in under: /src/4FileWrite
- Written using the MERN Stack (Mostly just React and Express)
-  My contributions 
    - I solely completed this project on my own
- The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my knowledge and abilities to use react. 

- The only major challenge I faced with completing this assignment was my lack of understanding of how to use the async tools. This in turn made things not work for a hot minute. After consulting with another classmate they mentioned that I should try using async and I never turned back. 
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would have added a nice front end. At the time of completion of this assignment, I hadn't completed anything in the front end yet and solely relied on a little HTML to help me get through this. Having my understanding now will make things a lot easier.
