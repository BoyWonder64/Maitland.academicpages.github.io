### Source Code in under: /src/FoodFinder
- Written using the MERN Stack
-  My contributions 
    - I solely completed this project on my own
- The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my knowledge and abilities to use react.
- This was the first API I have ever written. I enjoy this part of programming a lot. Breaking down big jobs into little ones help move things along. 
- This API is what later became my Banking program that was polished. This is where most of the logic was thought up.  

- The biggest challenge that I recall facing honestly was presenting this. I had so many different API requests that I had made and I needed to record a video showcasing them. I probably had to try at least 15 times to get everything right. 
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - Truthfully, I probably wouldn't change anything.
