### Source Code in under: /src/CodeProjects/Sessions
- Written using the MERN Stack
-  My contributions 
    - I solely completed this project on my own
- The purpose of this project was to demonstraight my knowledge and abilites to use sessions.
- This assignment took me a good minute to understand. I felt the instructions were a bit muggy.
- Once I got the hang of using sessions the rest of the assigment came together with ease. 
- Building on the previous work I had done with with the API. I then created a user interface. 
- This also is what led to my polished banking application  

- The biggest challenge I faced was trying to understand how I was supposed to use the sessions. The tutorial created a new page with routes that were session specific. These didnt make a lot of sense to me and it made completing this assignment very difficult 
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would have asked my professor more questions eariler as to not waste time trying to figure out what was required. to complete this.
