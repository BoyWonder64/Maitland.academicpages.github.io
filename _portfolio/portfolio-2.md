- Written using the MERN Stack 
-A polished site that utilizies Tailwinds
- Using the MERN Stack, Mongo DB was implamented
- User passwords are stored using SHA-256 hashing
- Protected roles were implamented to allow Admins, Employees and Customers navigate to their appropiate sites
- The largest challenge I faced with this project was figuring out how to allow one user to transfer money to another user in the backend. I solved this by reworking some previous code I used to allow a single user to perform the transfer
