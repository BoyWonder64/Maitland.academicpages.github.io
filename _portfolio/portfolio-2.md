- Written using the MERN Stack 
- A polished site that utilizes Tailwinds
- Using the MERN Stack, Mongo DB was implemented
- My contributions 
    - The majority of the backend logic regarding the Admin, Employee, and Customer
    - The MongoDB setup and integration
    - The SHA-256 password encryption
- User passwords are stored using SHA-256 hashing
- Protected roles were implemented to allow Admins, Employees, and Customers to navigate to their appropriate sites
- The largest challenge I faced with this project was figuring out how to allow one user to transfer money to another user in the backend.  
    - I solved this by reworking some previous code I used to allow a single user to perform the transfer
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would have liked to include just a few more theming elements as it stands right now, it's just a classy white. If I could maybe add a few more logos.
    - More font theming
    - Buttons to help navigate the user instead of having to rely on the knowledge of the backend routes.
