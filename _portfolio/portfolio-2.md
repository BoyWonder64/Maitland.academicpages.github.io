- Written using the MERN Stack 
- A polished site that utilizies Tailwinds
- Using the MERN Stack, Mongo DB was implamented
- My contributions 
    - The majority of the backend logic regarding the Admin, Employee, and Customer
    - The MongoDB setup and intergration
    - The SHA-256 password encryption
- User passwords are stored using SHA-256 hashing
- Protected roles were implamented to allow Admins, Employees and Customers navigate to their appropiate sites
- The largest challenge I faced with this project was figuring out how to allow one user to transfer money to another user in the backend. I solved this by reworking some previous code I used to allow a single user to perform the transfer
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would had liked to included just a few more themeing elements. As it stands right now, its just a classy white. If I could maybe add a few more logos.
    - More font themeing
    - Buttons to help navigate the user instead of having to rely on the knowledge of the backend routes.
