- Written using the MERN Stack
-  My contributions 
    - I solely completed this project on my own
- The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my knowledge and abilities to use react. 

- I faced many challenges when built this game. 
    - The largest being figuring out how the diagonals. I resolved this by using a hard-coded array and then simply checking if each option was in the array.
    - An additional challenge I faced was having to learn how to complete this project inside of react. This was the second project I have ever completed inside of it and it was very demanding of my time and energy. 
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would probably find a better way to determine if a diagonal has been fulfilled or not. Hard coding each of the sections worked but took up a lot of space. Finding a more simple method of completing this would have helped make this project much cleaner.
