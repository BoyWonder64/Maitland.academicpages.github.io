üë®üèª‚Äçüíª  About Me
üí°  I‚Äôm a Computer Science Student and have lots of work experience in Software Engineering.
üå±  I enjoy creative problem-solving, and yes I do enjoy debugging.
üöµ  In my free time, I listen to mountain bike, read books, and 3D Print.


Feel free to check out my portfolio and contact me if you have any questions or inquiries.
Using the Academic Pages template, I added and built a portfolio that displays my work.

 # Hangman Game #

### Source Code in under: /src/CodeProjects/Hangman
[Link to Repo: Banking Repository](https://github.com/BoyWonder64/GroupProject3750-Hangman)
- Written using the MERN Stack
- Set Up a basic server using Express to handle API requests.
- My contributions
    - I set up the CSV library
    - The guessing logic /guess and /hangman routes
    - The setup for sessions that helps select a word from the list
- Established a basic frontend and backend that communicated to each other.
- Create a database that contains various references to Marvel, Star Wars, and DBZ
- The largest challenge I faced was learning how to properly format the frontend page.
- Most of what was completed was done in react.
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would probably incorporate tailwinds and use more animations.
    - I've have been meaning to get into animating on my pages to improve the user experience. 
    - Finally, I would add a fun twist to the game.

### Source Code in under: /src/CodeProjects/BankingFrontEnd
[Link to Repo: Banking Repository](https://github.com/BoyWonder64/GroupProject3750-Hangman)
- Written using the MERN Stack 
- A polished site that utilizes Tailwinds
- Using the MERN Stack, Mongo DB was implemented
- My contributions 
    - The majority of the backend logic regarding the Admin, Employee, and Customer
    - The MongoDB setup and integration
    - The SHA-256 password encryption
- User passwords are stored using SHA-256 hashing
- Protected roles were implemented to allow Admins, Employees, and Customers to navigate to their appropriate sites
- The largest challenge I faced with this project was figuring out how to allow one user to transfer money to another user in the backend.  
    - I solved this by reworking some previous code I used to allow a single user to perform the transfer
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would have liked to include just a few more theming elements as it stands right now, it's just a classy white. If I could maybe add a few more logos.
    - More font theming
    - Buttons to help navigate the user instead of having to rely on the knowledge of the backend routes.

### Source Code in under: /src/CodeProjects/4InARow
[Link to Repo: 4 In A Row](https://github.com/BoyWonder64/4InARow.git)
- Written using the MERN Stack
-  My contributions 
    - I solely completed this project on my own
- The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my knowledge and abilities to use react. 

- I faced many challenges when built this game. 
    - The largest being figuring out how the diagonals. I resolved this by using a hard-coded array and then simply checking if each option was in the array.
    - An additional challenge I faced was having to learn how to complete this project inside of react. This was the second project I have ever completed inside of it and it was very demanding of my time and energy. 
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would probably find a better way to determine if a diagonal has been fulfilled or not. Hard coding each of the sections worked but took up a lot of space. Finding a more simple method of completing this would have helped make this project much cleaner.

### Source Code in under: /src/CodeProjects/4FileWrite
- Written using the MERN Stack (Mostly just React and Express)
-  My contributions 
    - I solely completed this project on my own
- The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my knowledge and abilities to use react. 

- The only major challenge I faced with completing this assignment was my lack of understanding of how to use the async tools. This in turn made things not work for a hot minute. After consulting with another classmate they mentioned that I should try using async and I never turned back. 
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would have added a nice front end. At the time of completion of this assignment, I hadn't completed anything in the front end yet and solely relied on a little HTML to help me get through this. Having my understanding now will make things a lot easier.

# My First API EVER! - Food Finder #

### Source Code in under: /src/CodeProjects/FoodFinder
- Written using the MERN Stack
-  My contributions 
    - I solely completed this project on my own
- The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my knowledge and abilities to use react.
- This was the first API I have ever written. I enjoy this part of programming a lot. Breaking down big jobs into little ones help move things along. 
- This API is what later became my Banking program that was polished. This is where most of the logic was thought up.  

- The biggest challenge that I recall facing honestly was presenting this. I had so many different API requests that I had made and I needed to record a video showcasing them. I probably had to try at least 15 times to get everything right. 
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - Truthfully, I probably wouldn't change anything. 

# Sessions #

![sessions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d7d27ed-e199-46bb-99b4-394c1c1ddc2e)

### Source Code in under: /src/CodeProjects/Session
- Written using the MERN Stack
-  My contributions 
    - I solely completed this project on my own
- The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my knowledge and abilities to use sessions.
- This assignment took me a good minute to understand. I felt the instructions were a bit muggy.
- Once I got the hang of using sessions the rest of the assignment came together with ease. 
- Building on the previous work I had done with the API. I then created a user interface. 
- This also is what led to my polished banking application  

- The biggest challenge I faced was trying to understand how I was supposed to use the sessions. The tutorial created a new page with routes that were session-specific. This didnt make a lot of sense to me and it made completing this assignment very difficult 
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would have asked my professor more questions earlier as to not waste time trying to figure out what was required. to complete this.
