👨🏻‍💻  About Me
💡  I’m a Computer Science Student and have lots of work experience in Software Engineering.
🌱  I enjoy creative problem-solving, and yes I do enjoy debugging.
🚵  In my free time, I listen to mountain bike, read books, and 3D Print.


Feel free to check out my portfolio and contact me if you have any questions or inquiries.
Using the Academic Pages template, I added and built a portfolio that displays my work.
