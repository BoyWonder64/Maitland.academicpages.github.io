👨🏻‍💻  About Me
💡  I’m a Computer Science Student and have lots of work experience in areas of Software Engineering and Data Engineering.
🌱  I like creating simplified solutions and love to explore new technologies.
🚵  In my free time, I listen to mountain bike, read books, and 3D Print.


Using the Academic Pages template, I added and built a portfolio that displays my work.
