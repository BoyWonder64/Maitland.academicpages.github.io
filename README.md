 # Hangman Game # 
### Source Code in under: /src/CodeProjects/Hangman
[Link to Repo: Banking Repository](https://github.com/BoyWonder64/GroupProject3750-Hangman)
- Written using the MERN Stack
- Set Up a basic server using Express to handle API requests.
- My contributions
    - I setup the CSV library
    - The guessing logic /guess and /hangman routes
    - The setup for sessions that helps select a word from the list
- Established a basic frontend and backend that communicated to each other.
- Create a database that contains various references to Marvel, Star Wars, and DBZ
- The largest challenge I faced was learning how to properly format the frontend page.
- Most of what was completed was done in react.
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would probably incorperate tailwinds and use more animations.
    - I've have been meaning to get into animating on my pages to improve the user experience. 
    - Finally, I would add a fun twist to the game. 



# Banking Application #
### Source Code in under: /src/CodeProjects/BankingFrontEnd
[Link to Repo: Banking Repository](https://github.com/BoyWonder64/GroupProject3750-Hangman)
- Written using the MERN Stack 
- A polished site that utilizes Tailwinds
- Using the MERN Stack, Mongo DB was implemented
- My contributions 
    - The majority of the backend logic regarding the Admin, Employee, and Customer
    - The MongoDB setup and integration
    - The SHA-256 password encryption
- User passwords are stored using SHA-256 hashing
- Protected roles were implemented to allow Admins, Employees, and Customers to navigate to their appropriate sites
- The largest challenge I faced with this project was figuring out how to allow one user to transfer money to another user in the backend.  
    - I solved this by reworking some previous code I used to allow a single user to perform the transfer
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would had liked to include just a few more theming elements as it stands right now, its just a classy white. If I could maybe add a few more logos.
    - More font theming
    - Buttons to help navigate the user instead of having to rely on the knowledge of the backend routes.

# 4 In a Row #
### Source Code in under: /src/CodeProjects/4InARow
[Link to Repo: 4 In A Row](https://github.com/BoyWonder64/4InARow.git)
- Written using the MERN Stack
-  My contributions 
    - I solely completed this project on my own
- The purpose of this project was to demonstraight my knowledge and abilites to use react. 

- I faced many challengnes when built this game. 
    - The largest being figuring how the diagnoals. I resolved this by using a hard coded array then simply checked if each option was in the array.
    - An additional challenge I faced was having to learn how to complete this project inside of react. This was the second project I have ever completed inside of it and it was very demanding of my time and energy. 
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would probably find a better way to determine if a diagonal has been fulfiled or not. Hard codeing each of the sections worked but takes up a lot of space. Finding a more simple method of completing this would have helped make this project much cleaner.

# FileWrite #
### Source Code in under: /src/CodeProjects/4FileWrite
- Written using the MERN Stack (Mostly just React and Express)
-  My contributions 
    - I solely completed this project on my own
- The purpose of this project was to demonstraight my knowledge and abilites to use react. 

- The only major challenge I faced with completing this assignment was my lack of understanding of how to use the async tools. This in turn made things not work for a hot minute. After consulting with another classmate they mentioned that I should try using async and I never turned back. 
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would have added a nice frontend. At the time of completion for this assignment I hadnt completed anything in the front end yet and solely relied on a little html to help me in get through this. Having my understanding now will make things a lot easier.

# My First API EVER! - Food Finder # 
### Source Code in under: /src/CodeProjects/FoodFinder
- Written using the MERN Stack
-  My contributions 
    - I solely completed this project on my own
- The purpose of this project was to demonstraight my knowledge and abilites to use react.
- This was my first API I have ever written. I enjoy this part of programming a lot. Breaking down big jobs into little ones that help move things along. 
- This API is what later became my Banking program that was polished. This is where most of the logic was thought up.  

- The biggest challenge that I recall facing honestly was presenting this. I had so many different API requests that I had made and I needed to record a video showcasing them. I probably had to try at least 15 times to get everything right. 
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - Truthfully, I probably wouldnt change anything. 

# Sessions #
### Source Code in under: /src/CodeProjects/Session
- Written using the MERN Stack
-  My contributions 
    - I solely completed this project on my own
- The purpose of this project was to demonstraight my knowledge and abilites to use sessions.
- This assignment took me a good minute to understand. I felt the instructions were a bit muggy.
- Once I got the hang of using sessions the rest of the assigment came together with ease. 
- Building on the previous work I had done with with the API. I then created a user interface. 
- This also is what led to my polished banking application  

- The biggest challenge I faced was trying to understand how I was supposed to use the sessions. The tutorial created a new page with routes that were session specific. These didnt make a lot of sense to me and it made completing this assignment very difficult 
- If I had to complete this project again...
    - I would have asked my professor more questions eariler as to not waste time trying to figure out what was required. to complete this.
